      <h1>Take Your Education To The Next Level!</h1>
      <p>
        Government ITI College provides practical knowledge and real technical skills to students.
        We focus on hands-on learning instead of only theory so that every student understands real industry work.
        Our courses help students become confident, independent and job ready.
        We also support students in interviews and career guidance.
        Our goal is to create skilled workers who can easily get employment in companies or start their own work.

      <h1>How We Improve Student Skills?</h1>
      <p>
        Students learn by performing practical work in workshops and computer labs daily.
        Teachers guide students step by step so they understand machines, tools and software properly.
        Real project based learning helps students gain confidence in real situations.
        We conduct internal tests, viva and practice sessions regularly.
        Industrial visits are also arranged so students can see real company environments.
        After course completion we provide placement support and interview preparation.
        Our training system focuses on skill, discipline and future career success.
